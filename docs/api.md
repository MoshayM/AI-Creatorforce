# api.md — AI CreatorForce

## 1. Conventions

- **Base URL:** `/api/v1`
- **Format:** JSON. `Content-Type: application/json`.
- **Auth:** session cookie (Auth.js) for the web app; `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` for service/API access. See `security.md`.
- **Validation:** every request body/query validated with Zod; 422 on failure with field errors.
- **Async pattern:** long operations return `202 Accepted` with a `jobId`; clients poll `GET /jobs/:id` or subscribe over WS/SSE.
- **Idempotency:** mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Pagination:** cursor-based — `?cursor=&limit=` → `{ data, nextCursor }`.
- **Errors:** consistent envelope.

```jsonc

| GET | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/highlights` | Highlight[] ranked by finalScore |
| GET | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/recommendations` | Top-N clip recommendations (`?limit=5\|10\|20`, no AI call) |
| GET | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/chapters` | Chapter[] — contiguous YouTube-style chapters (Ai-video edit.md §5, Phase 5) |
| POST | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/detect-chapters` | Enqueue standalone CHAPTER_DETECTION (for videos analyzed before chapters shipped; self-skips if chapters exist) |
| PATCH | `/shorts-studio/chapters/:chapterId` | `{ title?, summary? }` — manual edit, sets `editedByUser` so re-detection keeps it |
| GET | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/search` | NL search over transcript embeddings (`?q=&limit=`): top matches with timestamps, chapter context, cosine score. One embedding call per query, no LLM |
| GET | `/shorts-studio/search` | Cross-video library search (`?q=`): matches grouped per video, ranked by best moment (§11) |
| POST | `/shorts-studio/social-content/:id/render-quote-card` | Render a QUOTE_CARD to a 1080×1080 PNG (IMAGE asset); idempotent; file via `GET /media/versions/:versionId/file` |

| POST | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/small-videos` | Batched chapter → SMALL_VIDEO candidates (16:9, 1–10 min, zero AI); same clip/timeline/render/export path as Shorts. Chapters under 60s are skipped |
| POST | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/church-pack` | Enqueue CHURCH_PACK_GENERATION: bible refs + discussion questions + devotional per chapter, ONE batched LLM call (§11/§12.4). Chapters with a devotional are skipped on re-run; results ride on `GET .../chapters` |
| POST | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/sync-chapters` | Publish the "0:00 Title" chapter block into the live YouTube description (replaces an existing block, keeps the rest). Needs ≥3 chapters; sets `chaptersSyncedAt`. CHAPTER_DETECTION also runs the reverse: a description that already defines chapters is imported as `source: IMPORTED` at zero tokens |
| GET | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/social-content` | SocialContent[] — quote cards, carousel, blog post, newsletter (§10) |
| POST | `/shorts-studio/videos/:id/social-content` | Enqueue SOCIAL_CONTENT_GENERATION: the full text pack in ONE batched call over chapters + top highlights (+ their transcript excerpts, so quotes are verbatim). Self-skips when content exists |

Pipeline stages run as child `AgentJob`s of the `SHORTS_ANALYZE` root and self-skip when their output rows already exist (resume semantics, `ai.md` §16). Requires `yt-dlp` (`YT_DLP_PATH`) for source download; Whisper ASR fallback uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`.


## 21. Copilot, Intents & Token Governor

Spec: repo-root `Ai-video edit.md` (§8, §12, §15) — one execution path for UI, chat, and voice; plan/status in `docs/video-hub.md`. All routes JWT-guarded.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/copilot/chat` | Conversational turn: `{ messages, inputMode?: 'text'\|'voice', confirmedCommand?, pendingCommand? }` → `{ reply, language, executed?, needsConfirmation?, fromCache?, tokensUsed? }`. Repeated phrases resolve from the intent cache (zero tokens); confirmation-gated commands (`EXPENSIVE_ACTIONS`) always return `needsConfirmation` first. |
| POST | `/intents` | Unified UI entry point: `{ command: CopilotCommand, confirmed?: boolean }` → ActionResult `{ intentId, status: 'executed'\|'needs_confirmation', fromCache, tokensUsed, payload }`. Same executor, gates, and audit trail as chat/voice — intent parity by construction. |
| GET | `/intents/:id` | Fetch the ActionRecord audit row for an executed intent (owner-scoped). |
| GET | `/token-usage/summary` | `?days=30` → total tokens/cost, per-model breakdown (all AI calls in the process, agents included), copilot cache-hit rate (§12.3 target ≥80%), and `byVideo` — top-15 per-video cost rows (§12.2.8). Feeds the Analytics "AI Usage" card + cost-by-video table. |

## 22. Wallet, Recharge & Admin (billing spec)

Spec: `docs2/AI-CreatorForce-Billing-Payment-Security-Spec.md`; plan/status in `docs/billing-security.md`. JWT-guarded; admin routes additionally require RBAC permissions (`common/rbac.ts`).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/wallet/balance` | Balance + bucket breakdown (promo/bonus/referral/purchased) |
| GET | `/wallet/transactions` | Credit-ledger entries (`?take=`) |
| POST | `/wallet/recharge` | `{ amountUsd, successUrl, cancelUrl }` + mandatory `Idempotency-Key` header → Stripe Checkout URL. Credits granted only by the verified webhook |
| GET | `/admin/billing/revenue` | `admin:revenue` — gross/credits by gateway |
| GET | `/admin/audit-logs` | `admin:audit-logs` |
| GET | `/admin/users` | `admin:users` — roles + wallet/plan |
| POST | `/admin/wallet/adjust` | `wallet:adjust` — grant/claw back credits with reason; audited with before/after |
| POST | `/admin/payments/:id/refund` | `billing:refund` — full/partial Stripe refund with proportional credit claw-back (clamped to balance, shortfall recorded); audited |
| POST | `/admin/users/:id/recharges-frozen` | `admin:users` — lift/apply the §7 dispute recharge freeze; audited |
| GET | `/admin/providers` | `admin:providers` — AI provider registry: status, health score, failure rate, current cost rates, recent health events (Phase 5 §5) |
| GET/POST/PATCH | `/admin/pricing-rules` | `admin:pricing` — credit pricing rules, most-specific-wins; create/update rejected below `MIN_PROFIT_MARGIN` (fail closed); audited. Rule prices are locked at reservation time |
| POST | `/admin/profit/preview` | `admin:pricing` — margin verdict for a hypothetical `{action, creditCost}` (Phase 5 §8) |
| GET | `/trial/status` | Trial grant status, remaining trial credits, expiry (Phase 6 §5) |
| GET | `/trial/limits` | Effective trial-tier restrictions + whether they apply to me |
| GET/PATCH | `/admin/trial-config` | `admin:trial` — trial credits/expiry + per-feature limits; audited |
| GET | `/admin/abuse-signals` | `admin:trial` — fingerprint/IP abuse decisions (Phase 6 §6) |
| POST | `/admin/trial/:userId/approve` | `admin:trial` — grant a PENDING_REVIEW trial after manual review |
| GET | `/upgrade/recommendations` | Behavior-driven upgrade nudges (frequency-capped); refreshes on read (Phase 6 §8) |
| POST | `/upgrade/recommendations/:id/dismiss` | Dismiss a nudge (suppresses that reason for 14 days) |
| GET/POST | `/admin/offers` | `admin:trial` — campaigns (FIRST_RECHARGE/WELCOME/LOYALTY/WINBACK/LOW_CREDIT with `targetRule`); creation margin-gated (fail closed); grants double-idempotent (Phase 6 §9/§10.1) |
| GET | `/offers` | My Offer Center: active campaigns I qualify for (behavior-targeted) |
| POST | `/offers/:id/redeem` | Redeem a direct-grant offer (idempotent per user); recharge-attached offers apply automatically at settle |
| GET | `/marketplace/packs` | Credit packs (`?region=` filters; global packs always included) (Phase 6 §12) |
| GET/POST/PATCH | `/admin/credit-packs` | `admin:pricing` — packs; creation margin-gated on real credit economics; audited |

Roles: `SUPER_ADMIN` > `OWNER` > `MEMBER`; elevated identities come from `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` / `OWNER_EMAILS` env config (never hardcoded). The `credit_ledger` is append-only and idempotent — every balance is reconstructable from it.

Reserve→settle (§5.3, opt-in `BILLING_ENFORCE_CREDITS`): jobs hold `JOB_RESERVE_CREDITS` and copilot turns `COPILOT_RESERVE_CREDITS` before AI runs; the real cost (accumulated via the AI usage context) settles as a `USAGE_DEBIT` of `ceil(costUsd × CREDITS_PER_USD × AI_CREDIT_MARKUP)`; failures release the hold. Holds expire after `HOLD_TTL_MINUTES` so crashes never strand credits.

Every turn lands in the `actions` audit table (source `UI`/`COPILOT`/`VOICE`, status, `fromCache`, `tokensUsed`); spoken turns also record `voice_commands` (raw transcript + resolved intent); `copilot_sessions` keeps compressed per-user intent history. The `token_usage` ledger is populated by a global usage hook on the shared aiClient — no AI call goes unmetered. Rows carry `userId`/`jobId`/`projectId`/`importedVideoId` attribution from an AsyncLocalStorage context (`common/ai-usage.context.ts`) set by the supervisor around each job dispatch, by the copilot around each chat turn, and by semantic search around query embeddings — no per-call plumbing.
